    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader program = sg_make_shader(effect_program_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.images[] or .fs.images[]

        SLOT_effect_iTexChannel1 = 0;
        SLOT_effect_iTexChannel0 = 1;

    Sampler bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.sampler[] or .fs.samplers[]

        SLOT_effect_iSmpChannel1 = 0;
        SLOT_effect_iSmpChannel0 = 1;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'uniforms':

        effect_uniforms_t uniforms = {
