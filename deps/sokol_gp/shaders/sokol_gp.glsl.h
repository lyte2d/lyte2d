                    Image: iTexChannel0
                    Sampler: iSmpChannel0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader program = sg_make_shader(sgp_program_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.images[] or .fs.images[]

        SLOT_sgp_iTexChannel0 = 0;

    Sampler bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.sampler[] or .fs.samplers[]
