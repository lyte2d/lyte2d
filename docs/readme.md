# Lyte2D

## What

Lyte2D is a comfy little Lua framework for game development that is OSS and free. Lyte2D is a work in progress,
but fairly feature complete! Think Love2D, but with a tighter API and built-in WASM support. Highlights include:

* 2D graphics: images, shapes, blending, fonts, vertex shaders and fragment shaders
* Audio: music and sound effects, with pan and pitch control
* Input: keyboard, mouse, joystick and gamepad
* Distribution: 1-2MB executables for OSX, Windows, Linux, and web (via WASM)
